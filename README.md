# hello-world
A repository for the first assignment in F694 - Genomics & Bioinformatics designed to familiarize myself with Github.

@Augustus-M-Snyder is a first-year PhD student in Kristin O'Brien's lab. Previously, he received a MSc degree in Marine Biology from the College of Charleston, SC in 2022 where he studied metabolic alterations in the spotted seatrout, _Cynoscion nebulosus_, in response to infection by the myxosporean parasite, _Kudoa inornata_. He is currently working on the physiological response of Antarctic icefishes and other notothenioids to hypoxia stress and aims to graduate in the Spring of 2026. He considers himself to be an amateur programmer, bioinformatician, and biostatistician.

# To-Do:
